        "1. Weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry container, mix the B and Be powders thoroughly to ensure uniformity. 3. Gradually add the Ru powder to the B-Be mixture while stirring continuously. 4. Finally, incorporate the Tm powder into the blend, ensuring an even distribution. 5. Use a mortar and pestle to grind the mixture further, if necessary, to achieve a fine powder consistency."
