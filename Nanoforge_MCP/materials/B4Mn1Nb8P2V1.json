        "1. Weigh each ingredient precisely using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, add the weighed B, Mn, Nb, P, and V. 3. Use a mortar and pestle to thoroughly mix the powders until a homogeneous blend is achieved, ensuring no clumps remain. 4. Transfer the mixture into a ball mill and mill for 2 hours for uniform particle size distribution."
