        "1. Weigh out 340 g of Co, 120 g of Er, 20 g of Mg, and 240 g of P using a precision balance. 2. In a clean, dry container, combine the weighed powders uniformly. 3. Use a mortar and pestle to grind the mixture for 15 minutes to achieve a fine and homogeneous powder. 4. Transfer the blended powder to a ball mill and mill for an additional 30 minutes to enhance uniformity."
