        "1. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coat). 2. Measure 15 g of Cadmium (Cd), 75 g of Cobalt (Co), and 180 g of Erbium (Er) using a precision balance. 3. In a clean, dry container, mix the measured Cd, Co, and Er powders thoroughly using a spatula or a mortar and pestle until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixture into a ball mill and mill for 2 hours to ensure even particle size distribution."
