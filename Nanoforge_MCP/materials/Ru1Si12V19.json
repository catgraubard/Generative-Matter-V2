In a clean, dry container, combine Ru and Si first, stirring gently with a spatula to ensure even mixing. 3. Gradually add V to the mixture, continuing to stir until a homogeneous blend is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixed powder to a suitable mold for shaping (dimensions: 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches)."
