        "1. Weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean mixing container, combine cobalt, erbium, terbium, and yttrium powders. 3. Gradually add the binder while mixing thoroughly to ensure an even distribution. 4. Slowly incorporate the filler until a homogenous mixture is formed. 5. Add the release agent and stir to combine. 6. If the mixture is too thick, add solvent dropwise until the desired consistency is achieved."
