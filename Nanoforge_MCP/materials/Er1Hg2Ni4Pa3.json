Slowly combine the Erbium and Mercury while stirring continuously to create a uniform mixture. 4. Gradually add the Nickel and Palladium into the mixture while stirring, ensuring an even distribution. 5. Transfer the combined mixture into a suitable mold that fits dimensions 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches."
