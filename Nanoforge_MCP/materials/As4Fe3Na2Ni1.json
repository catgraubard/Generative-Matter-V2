        "1. Measure out the specified amounts of Cr, Mn, Ni, P, and Tb using an analytical balance. 2. Place the metals into a clean, dry mixing bowl. 3. Mix the metals thoroughly using a spatula until evenly blended. 4. In a separate container, mix the binder and hardener according to the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring a homogeneous mixture. 5. Gradually add the metal mixture to the binder and hardener while stirring continuously until fully combined."
