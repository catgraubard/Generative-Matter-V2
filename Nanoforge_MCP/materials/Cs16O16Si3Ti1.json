In a clean, dry glass beaker, combine cesium oxide and silicon dioxide, stirring gently with a glass rod. 3. Gradually add titanium powder to the mixture while continuously stirring to ensure even distribution. 4. Carefully add the required amount of oxygen (ensure a controlled environment to avoid excessive exposure)."
