        "1. Measure and weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, combine the boron powder, cobalt powder, iron powder, niobium powder, and zinc powder. 3. Stir the mixture thoroughly for at least 10 minutes to ensure even distribution of all components. 4. Use a mortar and pestle or mechanical grinder for finer mixing if necessary. 5. Transfer the mixed powders into a suitable mold, ensuring it has the dimensions of 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches."
