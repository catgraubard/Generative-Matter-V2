      "steps": [
        "1. Measure 3 grams of cadmium, 20 grams of copper, 1 gram of mercury, and 4 grams of lanthanum using an analytical balance. 2. In a fume hood, carefully combine the measured powders in a clean, dry ceramic or glass mixing container. 3. Use a spatula to mix the powders thoroughly until a uniform blend is achieved. 4. Ensure that the mixture is free of clumps and has a consistent color."
