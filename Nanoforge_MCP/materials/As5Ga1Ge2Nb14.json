        "1. Measure each ingredient using a digital scale for accuracy. 2. In a clean, dry glass container, combine 2.5 g of arsenic, 0.5 g of gallium, 1.0 g of germanium, and 7.0 g of niobium. 3. Stir the mixture thoroughly using a non-reactive stirrer until all powders are uniformly blended. 4. Ensure that the environment is well-ventilated during the mixing process to avoid inhalation of dust."

Allow the epoxy to cure as per the manufacturer's instructions, typically 24 hours for full hardness."
