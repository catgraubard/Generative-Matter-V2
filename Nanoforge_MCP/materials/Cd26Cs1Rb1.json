        "1. Weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean glass or ceramic container, combine the 20 grams of Cd, 10 grams of Cs, and 5 grams of Rb. 3. Mix the powders thoroughly using a glass rod or a spatula until a uniform mixture is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixture into a suitable mold that can accommodate the dimensions 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches."
