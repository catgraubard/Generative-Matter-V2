        "1. Weigh each ingredient with a precision scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, add 100 g of La2O3, 10 g of Pr6O11, 20 g of RuO2, and 30 g of Sm2O3. 3. Mix the dry powders thoroughly using a spatula or mechanical mixer for at least 10 minutes until uniform. 4. In a separate container, dissolve 15 g of binder in 50 g of distilled water, stirring until fully mixed. 5. Gradually add the binder solution to the dry mixture while stirring continuously to achieve a homogenous paste."
