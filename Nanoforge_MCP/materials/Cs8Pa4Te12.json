        "1. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coat). 2. Weigh 32.00 g of Cesium (Cs) using a digital scale. 3. Weigh 16.00 g of Palladium (Pa). 4. Weigh 48.00 g of Tellurium (Te). 5. In a clean, dry glass container, add the Cs, Pa, and Te in the specified order. 6. Use a glass rod to mix the powders thoroughly for 10 minutes, ensuring a uniform distribution. 7. Transfer the mixed powder into a crucible suitable for high-temperature applications."
