Stir the dry mixture thoroughly using a spatula until uniformly mixed. 4. Measure 50 g of binder and 20 g of hardener. 5. In a separate container, mix the binder and hardener according to the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring thorough mixing. 6. Gradually add the dry metal mixture to the binder-harder mixture while stirring continuously. 7. Add 100 g of filler and mix until a homogeneous paste is formed."
