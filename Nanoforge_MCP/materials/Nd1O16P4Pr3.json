        "1. Begin by measuring 120 g of Nd2O3, 40 g of P2O5, and 60 g of Pr6O11 using a digital scale for accuracy. 2. In a clean, dry glass or ceramic mixing container, combine Nd2O3 and P2O5 thoroughly using a ceramic spatula. 3. Gradually add Pr6O11 to the mixture while continuously stirring to ensure uniformity. 4. Once all ingredients are combined, ensure there are no lumps and the mixture is homogeneous."
