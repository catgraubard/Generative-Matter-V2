      "steps": [
        "1. Weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, combine 14 g of Cs, 7 g of Fe, 1 g of Li, and 16 g of S. 3. Use a spatula to mix the powders thoroughly until a homogeneous blend is achieved, ensuring no clumps remain. 4. Transfer the mixture to a mortar and pestle for further grinding to achieve a finer consistency. 5. Continue grinding until the mixture is uniform and fine in texture."
