        "1. Weigh each ingredient (As, Co, Na, Ru) using a precise scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, combine the weighed amounts: 7 g of As, 9 g of Co, 2 g of Na, and 3 g of Ru. 3. Stir the mixture thoroughly with a non-reactive stirrer for at least 5 minutes to ensure uniform distribution. 4. Transfer the mixture into a crucible suitable for high-temperature reactions."
