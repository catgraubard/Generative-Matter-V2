In a fume hood, combine sulfur and selenium in a clean, dry mixing container. 4. Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure even distribution of selenium within the sulfur. 5. Gradually introduce the ozone to the sulfur-selenium mixture, ensuring proper ventilation and safety precautions. 6. Mix until a uniform consistency is achieved."
