        "1. Weigh each ingredient precisely using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, combine the weighed Cobalt, Iron, Manganese, Phosphorus, and Yttrium powders. 3. Use a spatula to mix the powders thoroughly for 10 minutes to ensure uniform distribution. 4. Transfer the mixed powders into a ball mill and mill for an additional 30 minutes to achieve a fine, homogenous powder."
