        "1. In a clean, dry environment, weigh out each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. Combine B, Li, Mg, Nb, and Ru in a ceramic or glass mixing container. 3. Use a mortar and pestle to thoroughly mix the powders until a uniform consistency is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixture into a suitable mold for shaping the solid sample (3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches)."
