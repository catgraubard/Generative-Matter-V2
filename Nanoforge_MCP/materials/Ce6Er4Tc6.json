Add 150 g of binder and 30 g of hardener to the metallic mixture. 4. Gradually add 50 g of silica filler while stirring continuously to ensure uniform distribution. 5. Mix thoroughly until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. 6. Prepare a mold with dimensions 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches and apply 10 g of release agent evenly on the inner surfaces."
