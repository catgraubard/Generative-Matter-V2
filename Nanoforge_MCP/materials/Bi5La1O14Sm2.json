        "1. Measure 12 g of Cs accurately using a digital scale. 2. Weigh 3 g of Nb. 3. Measure 16 g of Se. 4. Weigh 1 g of V. 5. In a clean, dry container, combine all the measured ingredients thoroughly using a spatula to ensure a homogeneous mixture. 6. Transfer the mixture to a suitable grinding mortar and pestle. 7. Grind the mixture for 15 minutes to achieve a fine powder consistency."
