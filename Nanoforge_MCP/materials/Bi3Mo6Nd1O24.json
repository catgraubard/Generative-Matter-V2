        "1. Measure and weigh out 60 g of Bismuth Oxide, 120 g of Molybdenum Oxide, and 10 g of Neodymium Oxide using an analytical balance. 2. In a clean glass beaker, combine the oxides. 3. Slowly add 50 g of deionized water while stirring continuously to form a slurry. 4. Add 25 g of ethanol to the mixture and stir until a homogeneous paste is formed. 5. Ensure no lumps remain in the mixture."
