        "1. Gather all materials and protective equipment (gloves, goggles). 2. Weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 3. In a fume hood or well-ventilated area, carefully combine the measured amounts of Silver, Mercury, Nickel, and Zirconium in a glass or ceramic mixing container. 4. Use a stir rod to mix the powdered ingredients thoroughly until a homogenous mixture is achieved."
