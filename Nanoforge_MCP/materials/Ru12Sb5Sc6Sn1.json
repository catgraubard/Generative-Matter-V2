        "1. Weigh each ingredient accurately using a digital scale. 2. Place Ru, Sb, Sc, and Sn in a clean, dry mixing container. 3. Use a ceramic or glass rod to mix the powders thoroughly until a uniform blend is achieved. 4. Ensure that the mixing is done in a fume hood or well-ventilated area to avoid inhalation of fine powders."
