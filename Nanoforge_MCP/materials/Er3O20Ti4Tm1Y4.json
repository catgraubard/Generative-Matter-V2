        "1. Wear appropriate safety gear (gloves, goggles, lab coat). 2. In a clean, dry container, measure 5.0 g of Cs, 12.0 g of Na, and 60.0 g of Sb. 3. Using a mortar and pestle, finely grind the Na and Sb together until a homogeneous powder is achieved. 4. Slowly add the Cs into the mixture while continuing to grind. Ensure a uniform mixture free of lumps. 5. Transfer the mixture to a pre-cleaned crucible suitable for high-temperature use."
