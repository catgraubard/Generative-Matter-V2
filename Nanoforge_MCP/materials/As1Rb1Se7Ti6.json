        "1. Wear appropriate safety gear including gloves and goggles. 2. Weigh out 15.0 g of As, 3.0 g of Rb, 45.0 g of Se, and 12.0 g of Ti using a precision scale. 3. In a fume hood, combine the materials in a clean glass or ceramic mixing container. 4. Mix thoroughly for 10 minutes to ensure a homogeneous blend."
