        "1. Weigh out each element precisely using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, add the aluminum powder first. 3. Gradually add the cobalt powder, ensuring even distribution. 4. Follow with ruthenium, scandium, and yttrium powders, mixing thoroughly after each addition. 5. Use a mechanical mixer for uniformity if available. 6. Once mixed, transfer the blend into a mold that fits the desired dimensions (3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches)."
