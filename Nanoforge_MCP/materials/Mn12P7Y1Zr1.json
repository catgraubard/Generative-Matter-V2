        "1. Measure each metal powder (Mn, P, Y, Zr) accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry container, combine the measured metal powders. 3. Add the silica or alumina filler to the metal mixture. 4. Mix the powders thoroughly using a spatula or mechanical mixer until a uniform blend is achieved. 5. In a separate container, prepare the epoxy resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6. Gradually add the hardener to the resin while stirring continuously. 7. Once the resin and hardener are mixed, slowly incorporate the metal powder blend into the resin mixture. Stir until evenly dispersed."
