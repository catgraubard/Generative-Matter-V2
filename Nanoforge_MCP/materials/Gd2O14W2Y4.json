        "1. Measure 100 g of Gd2O3, 50 g of W2O3, and 80 g of Y2O3. 2. In a clean mixing bowl, combine all the oxides thoroughly using a spatula until homogenous. 3. In a separate container, dissolve 20 g of PVA in 30 g of distilled water, stirring until fully dissolved. 4. Slowly add the PVA solution to the powdered oxides while mixing continuously to form a paste-like consistency."
