        "1. Weigh out 60 g of CsI, 10 g of RbI, 100 g of SiO2, and 240 g of TeO2 using an analytical balance. 2. In a clean, dry glass beaker, combine the CsI and RbI. 3. Gradually add the SiO2 to the mixture while stirring with a glass rod to ensure uniform distribution. 4. Finally, add the TeO2 while continuously stirring to create a homogenous mixture."
