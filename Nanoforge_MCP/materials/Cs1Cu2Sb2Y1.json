        "1. Weigh out 10 g of Cs, 20 g of Cu, 30 g of Sb, and 5 g of Y using a precise scale. 2. In a dry, inert atmosphere (e.g., argon-filled glovebox), combine the weighed ingredients in a clean, dry mixing container. 3. Use a mortar and pestle to thoroughly mix the powders until a uniform blend is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixed powder into a suitable crucible for heating."
