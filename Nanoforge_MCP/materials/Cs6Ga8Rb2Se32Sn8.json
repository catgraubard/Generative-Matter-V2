        "1. Wear appropriate PPE including gloves, goggles, and a lab coat. 2. In a fume hood, measure 12.0 g of Hg, 4.0 g of Rb, and 14.0 g of Se using an analytical balance. 3. In a clean, dry container, carefully combine the Hg and Rb. 4. Gradually add Se to the mixture while stirring continuously to ensure even distribution without clumping. 5. Once fully mixed, transfer the blend to a crucible suitable for high-temperature processing."
