        "1. Wear appropriate safety gear including gloves and goggles. 2. In a clean and dry mixing container, measure 10 g of Acetate. 3. Add 5 g of Beryllium to the container. 4. Next, add 80 g of Nickel to the mixture. 5. Finally, add 45 g of Silicon to the container. 6. Using a non-reactive mixing tool, stir the mixture thoroughly for 10 minutes to ensure an even blend of all components. 7. Ensure the mixture is homogeneous and free from lumps."
