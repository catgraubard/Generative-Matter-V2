        "1. Weigh each material accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, combine 12 g of B6, 18 g of Mn2, 6 g of Pr1, and 24 g of Tm4. 3. Stir the mixture thoroughly using a stainless steel spatula until the components are uniformly distributed. 4. Ensure there are no clumps and that the mixture appears homogenous."
