Weigh 300 g of the oxidizing agent and 150 g of silica. 4. Mix the arsenic and phosphorus thoroughly in a glass container to ensure a homogenous blend. 5. Gradually add the zirconium to the arsenic-phosphorus mix while stirring continuously. 6. Slowly incorporate the oxidizing agent and silica into the mixture, ensuring uniform distribution. 7. Transfer the mixture into a crucible suitable for high-temperature applications."
