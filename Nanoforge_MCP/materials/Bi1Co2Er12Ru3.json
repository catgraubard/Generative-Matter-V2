        "1. Measure out 20 g of Bi, 40 g of Co, 240 g of Er, and 60 g of Ru using a precision scale. 2. Place the Bi, Co, Er, and Ru in a clean, dry mixing container. 3. Use a glass rod to stir the mixture thoroughly until a homogeneous powder is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixture to a mortar and pestle for finer grinding if necessary. 5. Ensure that the mixture is free of clumps and evenly mixed."
