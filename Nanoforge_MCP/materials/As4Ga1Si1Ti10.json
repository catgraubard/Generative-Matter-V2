In a clean mixing container, combine the K, Mn, S, and Tc powders thoroughly. 4. In a separate container, mix 50 g of epoxy resin with 5 g of glycerol to create a binder solution. 5. Slowly add the binder solution to the powdered mixture while stirring continuously until a uniform paste forms. 6. Gradually incorporate 60 g of silica filler to enhance the structure, ensuring even distribution."
