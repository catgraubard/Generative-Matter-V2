        "1. Weigh out 10.00 g of La, 4.00 g of P, 76.00 g of Ru, and 0.50 g of Sm using an analytical balance. 2. Combine the measured powders in a clean, dry mixing container. 3. Use a mortar and pestle to grind the mixture until a uniform powder is achieved, ensuring all components are thoroughly blended. 4. Transfer the mixed powder to a ball mill for 1 hour to achieve a finer particle size and better homogeneity."
