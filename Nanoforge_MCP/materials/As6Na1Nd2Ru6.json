        "1. In a well-ventilated fume hood, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 2. Weigh each ingredient precisely using an analytical balance. 3. In a clean, dry glass beaker, combine 6 grams of Arsenic with 1 gram of Sodium. 4. Stir the mixture gently until uniform. 5. Next, add 2 grams of Neodymium and 6 grams of Ruthenium to the beaker. 6. Continue stirring until all components are well integrated. 7. Transfer the mixture to a high-purity crucible suitable for melting metals."
