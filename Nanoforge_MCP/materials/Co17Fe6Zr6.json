        "1. Weigh out 255 g of cobalt powder, 102 g of iron powder, and 102 g of zirconium powder using a precision scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, combine the three powders thoroughly using a mechanical mixer or mortar and pestle until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. 3. Ensure the mixture is free of clumps by sieving it through a fine mesh screen."
