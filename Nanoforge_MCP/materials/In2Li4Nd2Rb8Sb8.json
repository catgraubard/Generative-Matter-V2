        "1. Weigh each ingredient using an analytical balance for precision. 2. In a clean, dry glass container, add the indium first. 3. Gradually add lithium while stirring gently to ensure proper mixing. 4. Add neodymium and rubidium, stirring continuously. 5. Finally, incorporate antimony into the mixture, maintaining a homogeneous blend. 6. Ensure all materials are finely powdered and well-combined."
