        "1. Wear appropriate safety gear (gloves, goggles, and mask) to handle metals safely. 2. Measure out each ingredient using a precision scale. 3. In a clean, dry container, combine 20 g of antimony, 40 g of tin, 30 g of titanium, and 60 g of zirconium. 4. Mix the powders thoroughly using a spatula or mechanical mixer until a homogeneous mixture is achieved."
