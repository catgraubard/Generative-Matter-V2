        "1. Wear appropriate PPE: gloves, goggles, and lab coat. 2. In a fume hood, measure 4.0 g of arsenic, 8.0 g of cadmium, and 4.0 g of mercury using a precise balance. 3. In a separate container, measure 20 g of oxygen gas (if using as a compressed cylinder, ensure to take appropriate precautions). 4. Carefully combine the arsenic, cadmium, and mercury in a ceramic crucible. Stir gently to ensure a homogenous mixture. 5. Gradually introduce oxygen into the mixture while continuously stirring."
