        "1. Measure each metal component accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, add Cd, Ce, Co, and Tm in the specified amounts. 3. Use a mechanical mixer or a mortar and pestle to thoroughly mix the powders until a homogenous blend is achieved. 4. In a separate container, prepare the binder by mixing the epoxy resin with the hardener according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5. Gradually add the metal powder mixture to the binder while stirring continuously to ensure even distribution."
