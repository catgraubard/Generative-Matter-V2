        "1. Gather all materials in a clean, dry workspace. 2. Weigh each ingredient using an analytical balance for precision. 3. In a ceramic or metal container, add 16 g of cobalt. 4. Add 2 g of niobium to the container. 5. Incorporate 7 g of silicon into the mixture. 6. Finally, add 4 g of titanium. 7. Mix the powders thoroughly using a spatula or a mortar and pestle until a homogeneous blend is achieved. 8. Ensure no clumps remain and the mixture is uniform."
