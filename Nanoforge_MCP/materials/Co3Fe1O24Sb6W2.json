        "1. Weigh out each ingredient accurately using a digital scale.  2. In a clean mixing bowl, combine Cobalt Oxide, Iron(III) Oxide, Antimony Trioxide, Tungsten Oxide, and Calcium Carbonate.  3. Slowly add distilled water to the dry mixture while stirring continuously until a uniform paste forms.  4. Incorporate the PVA binder into the mixture, ensuring it is evenly distributed.  5. Mix thoroughly until the consistency is smooth and homogeneous."
