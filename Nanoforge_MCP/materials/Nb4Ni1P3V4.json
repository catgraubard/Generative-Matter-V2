        "1. Weigh out 120 g of Niobium (Nb), 30 g of Nickel (Ni), 90 g of Phosphorus (P), and 120 g of Vanadium (V) using a precise digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry environment, combine the Nb, Ni, P, and V powders in a ceramic or glass mixing container. 3. Use a stainless steel spatula to mix the powders thoroughly until a consistent blend is achieved. 4. Transfer the mixture to a ball mill and mill for 2 hours to ensure uniformity. 5. After milling, collect the powder and ensure it is free from lumps."
