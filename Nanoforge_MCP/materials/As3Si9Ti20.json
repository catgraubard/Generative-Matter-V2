        "1. Gather all materials in a well-ventilated area. 2. Measure out the arsenic, silicon, and titanium with a precision scale. 3. In a mixing container, combine 30 g of arsenic, 90 g of silicon, and 200 g of titanium. 4. Mix thoroughly using a stirrer or spatula until a homogeneous dry mixture is achieved. 5. In a separate container, prepare the binder by mixing 50 g of epoxy resin with 10 g of hardener. 6. Combine the dry mixture with the binder mixture gradually while stirring continuously until fully incorporated."
