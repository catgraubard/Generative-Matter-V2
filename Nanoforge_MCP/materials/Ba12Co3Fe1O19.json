        "1. Measure each material accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry container, add Ag first. 3. Gradually add Cd, stirring continuously to ensure even distribution. 4. Add Nd slowly while stirring, maintaining a consistent mixture. 5. Finally, incorporate Pb into the mixture, ensuring all components are homogeneously combined. 6. Transfer the mixture to a suitable mold with dimensions slightly larger than 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches to account for shrinkage."
