        "1. Weigh out 2.0 g of Boron, 0.4 g of Calcium, 3.0 g of Gadolinium, 16.0 g of Oxygen, and 1.0 g of Yttrium using an analytical balance. 2. Combine the weighed powders in a clean, dry ceramic or glass mixing container. 3. Use a mortar and pestle to thoroughly mix the powders until they form a homogeneous mixture. 4. Transfer the mixed powder into a suitable mold that fits the dimensions of 3 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches."
