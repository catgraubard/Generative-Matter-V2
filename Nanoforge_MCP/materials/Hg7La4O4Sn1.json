Measure 5.6 g of oxygen (O) and prepare for the reaction. 4. Measure 1.5 g of tin (Sn) and set aside. 5. In a fume hood, carefully combine Hg, La, and Sn in the mixing container and ensure thorough mixing. 6. Gradually introduce O while stirring to ensure uniform distribution. 7. Mix until a homogenous paste is formed."
