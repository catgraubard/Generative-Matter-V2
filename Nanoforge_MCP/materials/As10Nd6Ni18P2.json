        "1. In a well-ventilated area, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 2. Measure out 10 g of arsenic, 6 g of neodymium, 18 g of nickel, and 2 g of phosphorus accurately using a digital scale. 3. Combine the powders in a clean, dry glass or ceramic mixing container. 4. Use a spatula to thoroughly mix the powders to achieve a uniform blend."
