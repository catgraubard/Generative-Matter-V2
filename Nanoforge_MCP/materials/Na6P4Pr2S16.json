Mix the powders thoroughly using a mortar and pestle until a uniform blend is achieved. 4. In a separate container, measure 50 g of binder and 25 g of hardener, and mix them according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5. Gradually combine the powdered mixture with the binder mixture, stirring continuously to ensure even coating. 6. Slowly add 100 g of silica filler to the mixture while stirring to enhance mechanical properties."
