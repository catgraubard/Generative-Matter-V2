        "1. Weigh each material accurately using a digital scale. 2. In a clean, dry mixing container, add the weighed B, Fe, Ge, Nb, and Ru in the specified order. 3. Mix thoroughly with a spatula or mixing rod for 5 minutes to ensure uniform distribution of all components. 4. Transfer the mixture to a mortar and grind until a fine powder is achieved, approximately 10 minutes."
